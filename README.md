# Trading Strategy Tester
This is a maven project. Its task is to test different trading strategies with historic data.
Currently it is executable and prints results for pre-programmed stocks and time frames to the console.
In the future the user should be able to choose these things manually and front-end will be created.

Currently this project uses the trading analysis for java(ta4j) library and uses the tiingo stock API for historical data.
